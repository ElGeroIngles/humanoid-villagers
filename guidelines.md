- To-Do:
    - Features:
        - Add missing settings to the dialog menu to customize them.
        - Setting to allow for animations in mannequins, such as double crouching when near a player or enable the swimming pose while on water (defaults to true).
        - Add non-binary option to the pool.
    - Other:
        - Remember to enable in `init.mcfunction` the last line so the config isn't applied everytime the user reloads the world.
        - Add a lot of names, dialogs and skins to the pools.

- Done:
    - Setting to allow for conversations between Humans (defaults to true).
    - Setting to transform naturally spawning villagers from structures (and zombified ones too once they have been cured) to Humans, transform all villagers to Humans or only transform the specified entities to Humans (defaults to only villagers from villages).
    - Add support for baby villagers.
    - Setting to allow to hide the outer skin layers that the user may want to hide (defaults to show everything).
    - Setting to customize the "NPC" tag of mannequins.
    - Setting to allow default main hand, either left, right or random, and allow customization of the percentages (defaults to random and 90% for right-handed and 10% for left-handed).
    - Setting to toggle the "NPC" tag of mannequins.
    - Setting to pass all of the original entity's equipment to its human (defaults to true).
    - Setting to allow to use the name and skin of any player of the server, online or not (defaults to true).
    - Each one of them should have a different randomized skin and name.
    - Make the names and skins easily customizable.
