- To-Do:
    - Features:
        - Add non-binary option to the pool.
    - Other:
        - Remember to enable in `init.mcfunction` the last line so the config isn't applied everytime the user reloads the world.
        - Add a lot of names, dialogs and skins to the pools.
    - Bugs:

- Done:
    - Sometimes some dialogs are spammed without any cooldown (most likely needs a rewrite of the system).
    - Sometimes a dialog is spammed in chat with no participat.
    - Fix villagers hitbox, you can't place blocks on top of them.
    - When you hurt the villager, it's human doesn't become red (it doesn't seems as the player hit it) (run an effect as the victim).
    - Recicle ids when humans die (if the id of the human who died is $global-1, then set $global to that id).
    - Very bad performance when near a lot of humans.
    - Fix broken chances between players and random skins/names in the pool.
    - Fix broken bed animation.
    - New animation for when humans are in-doors while at night (crouching, so like hiding).
    - Setting to allow for animations in mannequins, such as double crouching when near a player or enable the swimming pose while on water (defaults to true).
    - Add a trigger to open the config dialog.
    - Add missing settings to the dialog menu to customize them.
    - Setting to allow for conversations between Humans (defaults to true).
    - Setting to transform naturally spawning villagers from structures (and zombified ones too once they have been cured) to Humans, transform all villagers to Humans or only transform the specified entities to Humans (defaults to only villagers from villages).
    - Add support for baby villagers.
    - Setting to allow to hide the outer skin layers that the user may want to hide (defaults to show everything).
    - Setting to customize the "NPC" tag of mannequins.
    - Setting to allow default main hand, either left, right or random, and allow customization of the percentages (defaults to random and 90% for right-handed and 10% for left-handed).
    - Setting to toggle the "NPC" tag of mannequins.
    - Setting to pass all of the original entity's equipment to its human (defaults to true).
    - Setting to allow to use the name and skin of any player of the server, online or not (defaults to true).
    - Each one of them should have a different randomized skin and name.
    - Make the names and skins easily customizable.
